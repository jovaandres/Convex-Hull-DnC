## General Information
This is a simple library to find the convex hull of a dataset using the divide and conquer algorithm.
The divide and conquer algorithm used is to divide the data set over two extreme lines continuously until two extreme lines are formed without other points outside. The two lines are the convex hull of the sub-problem being solved. Lll the solutions of the sub-problems are merged into a general solution.
